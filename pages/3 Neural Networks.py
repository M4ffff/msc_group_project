        This interactive Neural Network Tool enables users of all skill levels to configure, visualise, and explore
        there own neural network models through an intuitive interface. Navigate the following tabs to learn about various 
        components and parameters of neural networks, and examine how they influence the model's behaviour/outcomes
        and classification performance. This tool offers a hands-on, visual learning experience, introducing users to neural
        networks without the need for time-consuming programming. If you want to learn about the code, you can do that too, 
        under the **Python Implementation** tab.

        **1. Choose Your Dataset:**     
                        
        Select and adjust your dataset from the provided options, which include computer-generated datasets (Moons, Circles, Blobs).
        All datasets consist of 2 features and a target label for binary and multi-class classification tasks. 
        The computer-generated datasets allow you to customise the number of samples, noise level, and number of centres (for blobs).
        The dataset is then plotted.
        
        **2. Model Configuration:**
                    
        Take time to build and adjust various parameters and hyperparameters of your neural network before you start training. Customisable parameters 
        include:
        - Test dataset size 
        - Number of layers/ neurons 
        - Learning rate 
        - Activation function
        - Regularisation 
        - Optimisation algorithm
        - Epochs 
                    

        Hover over the **'?'** symbol next to each parameter for a hint on what the parameter does.       
        Once you are happy with your settings, click the **BUILD & TRAIN MODEL** button to begin!
                    
        **3. Explore the Model Output and Performance:**
                    
        Analyse your model's performance through a variety of evaluation metrics, loss curves, and execution time, while visualising 
        the decision boundary to gain insights into its behaviour. 

        **4. Repeat:**
                    
        Try out as many different configurations as you wish, hopefully gaining an intuition for the impact of each parameter on model outputs, 
        while demystifying the workings of neural networks.

                    **WHAT IT DOES:** Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is an optimisation algorithm that combines the advantages of two methods:

                    **1. Momentum:** Takes in to account past gradients to help smooth out parameter updates and reduce oscillations.
                    
                    **2. RMSProp:** Adapts the learning rate (step size) for each parameter based on previous gradient magnitudes.

                    **WHEN TOU USE:** Very widely used for many tasks, especially when the optimal learning rate is unknown. It is effective 
                    within deep, complex networks with lots of parameters due to its adaptive learning rate.

    st.markdown("""
                Regularistion is a machine learning technique used to prevent **overfitting** by penalising the model's complexity or large weights.
                When a model is overly complex, it can suffer from **memorising the training data** rather than learning patterns and, therefore, perform poorly 
                on unseen data. Regularisation helps the model to **generalise** better to new data.

                    - **Overfitting:** When a model learns the training data too well including noise and unnecessary details, rather than 
                    learning overall important patterns.
                        - **Signs:** High accuracy on the training dataset, with low accuracy on the test/validation dataset.
                        - **Potential Fixes:** Add regularisation, simplify the model, early stopping during training, add more training data to encourage better generalisation
                    \n
                    - **Underfitting:**  When the model is overly simple and cannot capture any patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on all datasets 
                        - **Signs:** Low accuracy on both training and test data, high bias (model makes strong assumptions)
                        - **Potential Fixes:** Increase model complexity, reduce regularisation, train for longer (more epochs)

                **Common Types of Regularisation:**

                - **L1 (Lasso)**
                    - Adds a penalty equal to the **absolute value** of the weights
                    - Effectively removes less important features by setting certain weights to 0, encouraging sparsity.
                    - Typically used on tasks where only a select few features are important.

                - **L2 (Ridge)**
                    - Adds a penalty equal to the **square value** of the weights 
                    - Stabilises the model by spreading large weights evenly across features
                    - Typically used for tasks that require all features but need model simplification.
                
                - **Dropout**
                    - Randomly deactivates (drops) neurons during each training step, forcing the network to learn many independent paths
                for the same conclusion. 
                    - This makes the model more robust and improves generalisation.
